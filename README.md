flask_scaffold
==============

Personal scaffolding around flask/backbone.js to learn the framework and as a starting point for future projs.

Assuming flask/python 2.7 is installed, experiment with

       $>python app.py

This app is just a dumb hello-world for Backbone/Flask/etc. The backbone models wrap a counter that can be incremented. The backbone view is a UI for incrementing/creating counters. The python backend just stores the counters in memory.
